## Data Analyst Nanodegree Project: Investigate a Dataset

This project involved using packages in Python, like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, to answer questions on a dataset of choice and present those findings. The dataset I used came from TMDb, or "The Movie Database", and contained information on over 10,000 movies. 

Files in this repository:

* `Investigating TMDb Movies Dataset.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing code and text cells used in analysis 
* `Investigating TMDb Movies Dataset.html` - HTML file for viewing Jupyter notebook without having to run code
* `References.rtf` - a list of web sites referred to or used in this project
* `tmdb-movies.csv` - the dataset used in the analysis
